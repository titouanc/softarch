\section{a}

This values were compared with the example seen in class.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ANDC too high -> high coupling, adding features more difficult, maintenance, subclass coupling
    \item AHH too high -> takes more time to compute (overloading) + \^ TO MUCH INHERITANCE
    \item NOM/NOC -> see below + small project -> not many methods
    \item LOC/NOM -> few methods per class but many lines per method => shoud refactor to have more modular methods
    \item CYCLO/LOC -> flat code -> good because less tests -> mainly adding/storing data -> declarative language ???
    \item CALL/NOM -> high but low FANOUT/CALL denotes that mostly operations from same class are called. so good coupling
    \item FANOUT/CALL -> low coupling thanks to facades
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item CYCLO/LOC -> maintenable and extensible
    \item 
\end{itemize}
