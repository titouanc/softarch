\section{a}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ANDC too high -> high coupling, adding features more difficult, maintenance
    \item AHH too high -> takes more time to compute (overloading) + ^
    \item NOM/NOC -> see below
    \item LOC/NOM -> few methods per class but many lines per method => shoud refactor to have more modular methods
    \item CYCLO/LOC -> flat code -> good because less tests -> declarative language ???
    \item FANOUT/CALL + CALL/NOM -> low coupling because on average each method uses 1.5 class
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item CYCLO/LOC -> maintenable and extensible
    \item 
\end{itemize}
