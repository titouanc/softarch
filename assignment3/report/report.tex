\section{Exercise 1 : BPEL Processes}

\subsection{Correct the error about the PortType}
    \subsubsection{What is the Port Type of a Webservice ? Why is it important for the Library
    Search BPEL process ?}

    \subsubsection{Why is it important for the Library
    Search BPEL process ?}

    \subsubsection{Using BPEL constructs, explain what happens in AssignResultSoftLib near
    the end of the process file}

\subsection{Notice that the SOFT Library only returns books in French, even though it has English books as well}

\subsubsection{Find out why this is the case, and correct the problem so that SOFT Library searcher returns books in English as well. Document the solution in the
report}

\subsubsection{Analyse the data that the two web services return. Are they the same? Why
could this be a problem in a system? What is a possible solution ?}

\section{Exercise 2 : Integration with Legacy Software}

– What did you change in the web portal application?
– How did your refactoring from the last assignment help or hinder you with
this task?
– Which pattern or architectural style did you use for the tasks (if any)?
– With respect to second part of Exercise 1 (Analysing the results of the two
web services): How did you integrate the results in the web portal application?
Which element in your architecture is responsible, and what are the benefits
and drawbacks of your design?

\section{Exercise 3 : Architecture}

• Chose an appropriate visualization, for example a UML or block diagram. The
diagram should allow to see the connections between the relevant elements in this
architecture, e.g., the involved web services, and the relevant parts of the web
portal application. Also minimally depict your architecture which results from
your design choices in exercise 2.

• Briefly describe your diagram and name the relevant concepts/architectural styles.
Do not go into the details for responsible classes etc., the architecture has to show
logical components, not primarily implementation details. Often you will have no
control over available web services, so treat the library web services as if they where
provided by external providers.
